        "- Small changes in the training data can lead to drastically different decision trees. This instability arises because the algorithm makes binary decisions at each split, which can magnify small variations in the data. This can make decision trees less reliable for certain applications.\n",

This can lead to suboptimal performance, especially in situations where the minority class is of particular interest.\n",
