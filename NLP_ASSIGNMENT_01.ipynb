        "- Chunking, also known as shallow parsing, involves grouping words together into \"chunks\" based on their part of speech.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Noun Phrase (NP) chunking specifically focuses on identifying noun phrases in a sentence. An NP typically consists of a determiner (like \"the\" or \"a\") followed by one or more adjectives and then a noun.\n",
